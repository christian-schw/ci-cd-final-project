## Introduction
This repository was created as part of IBM's "Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD)" course.<br>
It's a project about building a CI/CD pipeline.<br>
<br>
Much of the code was cloned from the IBM repository: https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/vselh-ci-cd-final-project-template<br>
<br>
Scenario: Youâ€™re part of a team responsible for building an innovative microservice, a RESTful API that allows users to manage and track counters.<br>
Another team has already developed the user interface (UI) for this microservice,<br>
and it's now your turn to ensure the reliability and efficiency of the backend services.<br>
<br>
Tasks that need to be completed:
- Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions - Linting and testing
- Continuous Deployment (CD) with OpenShift Pipelines - Linting, testing, building an image and deploying the microservice to an OpenShift Cluster

## Getting Started
After cloning you will need to run the `setup.sh` script in the `./bin` folder to install the prerequisite software.

```bash
bash bin/setup.sh
```

Then you must exit the shell and start a new one for the Python virtual environment to be activated.

```bash
exit
```
